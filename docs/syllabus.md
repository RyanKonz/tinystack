# Tinystack Syllabus

### Introduction

Tinystack will be developed into a production ready application over time. To get there, we will explore topics related to `programming best practices`, `go`, `large language models`, and share a few opinions along the way. This syllabus will attempt to be a map that guides you along the way.
